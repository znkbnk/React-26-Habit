Step 1: Create Local Storage Functions

First, we need to create two functions
to interact with localStorage for setting
and getting the theme preference.

Step 2: Initialize the Theme State

Next, initialize the theme state
using the getThemePreference function.

Step 3: Update the Toggle Theme Function

Modify the toggleTheme function to 
update the theme state and store the
theme preference in localStorage.

Step 4: Update Button Class Name

Update the class name of your button
based on the theme state. If the theme
is "dark," the button should have an
empty class for a white background,
and if the theme is "light," the button
should have the "white-background"
class for a black background.

Step 5: Update Sidebar.css

Establish a new rule for the 'dark'
theme to ensure that it displays
in white color.
